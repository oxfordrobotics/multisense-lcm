This is a standalone driver for the Multisense SL that communicates via
lcm (lightweight communication and marshalling).

Dependencies are currently:
  libmultisense (https://bitbucket.org/crl/libmultisense)
  lcm (https://github.com/lcm-proj/lcm)
  opencv (http://opencv.org/)

The driver is currently tested on linux (Ubuntu 12.04 and later), and is
built using pods (see below) and cmake. The application listens for
command_t messages to change sensor settings, and produces images_t
messages that contain color and depth images, imu_t messages that
contain raw imu readings, planar_lidar_t messages that contain raw laser
scans, and state_t messages that encode the laser spindle angle at the
beginning and end of each scan. Intrinsic and extrinsic sensor
calibration data is not handled by the driver.

This software is constructed according to the Pods software policies and
templates.  The policies and templates can be found at:
